                    <h2>Teaching philosophy</h2>
                    <p>​Traditional lecture-based teaching with little student participation has long been known to
                        ineffectively foster undergraduate learning. Reflecting on my own experiences as an undergrad, I
                        "learned by doing" via laboratory tasks, presentations, and writing assignments, rather than
                        memorizing and regurgitating information. Some of my most effective instructors combined
                        different
                        types of activities (class brain-storming, group break-out sessions, debates, games) to gain a
                        deeper understanding of the material. Such “active learning” has been demonstrated to increase
                        student test scores, and student perceptions of their own learning. The challenge is finding a
                        way
                        to spark curiosity in students, regardless of the specific subject being covered. If you are
                        interested in learning more about my teaching philosophy, you can access my full teaching

                        <h3>What is your favorite microbe?</h3>
                        <p>I had the privilege of volunteering at IGB’s largest science outreach event, the World of
                            Genomics
                            (WOG), held last year (2019) at the National Academy of Sciences (NAS) in Washington, D.C.
                            We
                            wanted
                            to use the event to introduce children and their parents to the importance of mobile DNA -
                            bits
                            of
                            DNA that can be picked up from the environment or another organism to encode a novel
                            function in
                            the
                            bearer. Unlike DNA that is inherited, passed down from one generation to the next, mobile
                            DNA
                            can be
                            acquired even within the same generation. Next Gen Sequencing has shown that mobile DNA
                            elements
                            are
                            widespread, found in organisms from every domain of life. But they are especially common in
                            microbes. ​</p>
                        <p>But how would you explain these concepts to young kids who have no background in genomics or
                            biology
                            and probably just want to play? ​Most of my past experience with SciComm has involved
                            explaining
                            my
                            science to other researchers and those familiar with my study system, and I did not know
                            much
                            about
                            designing card games for children. But I had tremendous help from the IGB Science Outreach
                            Team
                            headed by Dr. Courtney Fenlon as well as IGOH’s theme leader Dr. Rachel Whitaker and many of
                            the
                            theme members, especially my own supervisor Dr. Katy Heath. You can read more about the
                            process
                            of
                            how I went about designing the game in IGB's Zine here. But in the end, I realized that the
                            key
                            part
                            of the design process is one that envelopes all the steps. That’s to think all the time
                            about
                            why
                            you love a field of study and why you want to share it. I have presented the game at
                            different
                            venues since then, and every time learn a new way to get others excited about science.
                            Suffice
                            to
                            say, it's been such a rewarding experience!</p>
